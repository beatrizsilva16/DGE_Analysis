## Identify gene expression profiles in freshwater mussels under thermal stress

This repository contains part of my master thesis which addresses code for Differential Gene Expression (DGE) analysis using three methods, EdgeR, limma and DESeq2. This work is incorporated into to a project: EdgeOmics - Freshwater
Bivalves at the edge: Adaptation genomics under climate-change scenarios (http://doi.org/10.54499/PTDC/CTA-AMB/3065/2020). The present work was developed from my collaborative MSc thesis conducted between the School of Engineering at the University of Minho and Ciimar (Interdisciplinary Centre of Marine and Environmental Research of the University of Porto).

## Thesis Abstract

Due to global climate change, the temperatures of streams and rivers are increasing, negatively affecting
aquatic life, including bivalve species. Freshwater mussels are vital components of rivers, streams, and
lake ecosystems, participating in essential ecological roles such as nutrient cycling, and increasing water
quality. Furthermore, they serve as essential ecosystem engineers, providing habitat to other organisms
and supporting intricate food webs. Besides their biological importance, freshwater mussels are poorly
studied in terms of genomics. In the present work, the Iberian dolphin freshwater mussel
*Unio delphinus* Spengler, 1793 (Bivalvia: Unionoida) was used as a model species to investigate the effects of climate
change in freshwater mussels. The primary objective of this thesis was to determine the gene expression patterns in a model species of freshwater mussels under the effects of thermal stress exacerbated
by climate change, with an overall goal of understanding the larger consequences for freshwater mussel
populations. Two different ecological experiments were performed: chronic and acute. The chronic experiments where temperatures were gradually increased to simulate a scenario of progressive increasing
temperatures. The acute experiments where temperatures were rapidly increased to replicate the effects
of a briefer extreme climatic event. To achieve this main goal, a comprehensive bioinformatic pipeline
focused on transcriptomics analysis was developed using the R Bioconductor package to generate the
differential gene expression profiles of these individuals under thermal stress. The bioinformatic methodology of this work differs from the past studies, by developing an R code compilation of three methods,
EdgeR, limma, and DESeq2 for differential gene expression analysis in these organisms. The output of the
present work provides a comprehensive overview of gene expression profile responses of
*U. delphinus* under climate change scenarios. Additionally, the results revealed a wide range of pathways 
and the corresponding genes that are impacted by thermal stress, with a particular emphasis on the up-regulation of the
genes ATP6V1A, ATP6V0A1, ATP6V0A, and ATP6V1. In the chronic experiments, and high temperatures,
mussels expressed these genes and, interestingly, all the pathways that these genes included appeared
up-regulated. The discovered genes and pathways provide vital insights into these organisms adaptation
tactics and identify prospective targets for monitoring and conservation efforts.
