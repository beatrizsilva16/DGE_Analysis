## Identify gene expression profiles in freshwater mussels under thermal stress

This repository contains my master thesis which addresses code for DGE analysis using three methods, EdgeR, limma and DESeq2. This work is incorporated into to a project: EdgeOmics - Freshwater
Bivalves at the edge: Adaptation genomics under climate-change scenarios (http://doi.org/10.54499/PTDC/CTA-AMB/3065/2020).

## Thesis Abstract
Due to the fast progress of global climate change, the temperature of streams and rivers is increasing, affecting aquatic life, particularly bivalve species. Freshwater mussels are vital components of rivers, streams, and lake ecosystems, participating in essential roles such as nutrient cycling, and altering water quality. Furthermore, they serve as essential ecosystem engineers, offering habitat to other organisms and supporting intricate food webs. Besides their biological importance, freshwater mussels are poorly studied in terms of genomics. In the present work, the Iberian dolphin freshwater mussel *Unio delphinus* Spengler, 1793 (Bivalvia: Unionoida) is used as a model species to investigate the effects of the progress of climate change in freshwater mussels. The primary objective of this thesis is to determine the gene expression patterns in a model species of freshwater mussels under the effects of thermal stress exacerbated by climate change, with an overall goal of understanding the larger consequences for freshwater mussel populations. Two different ecological experiments were analyzed: chronic and acute. The chronic experiments where temperatures were gradually increased to simulate a scenario of progressive increasing temperatures, which reflects a prolongated heat wave. The acute experiments where temperatures were rapidly increased to replicate the effects of a briefer heat wave. To achieve this main goal, a comprehensive bioinformatic pipeline focused on transcriptomics analysis was developed using the R Bioconductor package to generate the differential gene expression profiles of these individuals under thermal stress. The bioinformatic methodology of this work differs from the past studies, by developing an R code compilation of three methods, EdgeR, limma, and DESeq2 for differential gene expression analysis in these organisms. The output of the present work provides a comprehensive overview of gene expression profile responses of Unio delphinus in the light of the progress of climate change. Additionally, the results revealed a wide range of pathways and the corresponding genes that are impacted by thermal stress, with a particular emphasis on the up-regulation of the genes ATP6V1A, ATP6V0A1, ATP6V0A, and ATP6V1. At a higher temperature of chronic experiments, mussels expressed these genes and, interestingly, all the pathways that these genes included appeared up-regulated. The discovered genes and pathways provide vital insights into these creaturesâ€™ adaptation tactics and identify prospective targets for monitoring and conservation efforts.
